Preprocessing is a crucial step in machine learning training. It involves preparing and cleaning the raw data before feeding it into a model. Proper preprocessing ensures that the model receives high-quality input, which helps improve its performance and accuracy. Here are the main steps in preprocessing:

1. Data Cleaning:

Handling Missing Values: Missing data can be filled with a mean, median, mode, or using more advanced techniques like interpolation. Alternatively, rows with missing values may be removed.

Removing Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate records to avoid bias in the model.

Correcting Inconsistencies: Ensuring data is consistent (e.g., spelling errors or misformatted data).



2. Data Transformation:

Normalization/Standardization: Scaling the features to a consistent range (e.g., 0 to 1) or distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) to prevent certain features from dominating the model due to larger ranges.

Log Transformation: Applying a log transformation to features that are skewed or exponentially distributed.



3. Feature Encoding:

Categorical Data Encoding: Converting categorical data into numerical formats. Common methods are:

Label Encoding: Assigning an integer to each category.

One-Hot Encoding: Creating binary columns for each category (useful for nominal variables).


Ordinal Encoding: For ordinal data where the categories have a meaningful order (e.g., 'low', 'medium', 'high').



4. Feature Engineering:

Feature Creation: Creating new features from existing ones based on domain knowledge (e.g., combining two features into one).

Feature Selection: Selecting the most relevant features that contribute the most to the modelâ€™s performance, and eliminating irrelevant or redundant ones (e.g., using techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance).
